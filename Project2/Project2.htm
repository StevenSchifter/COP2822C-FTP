                Hi everyone, I'm Steven Schifter. I'm currently enrolled in the <a href="https://catalog.valenciacollege.edu/degrees/associateinscience/informationtechnology/computerprogramminganalysis/#certificatestext:~:text=Computer Programming Specialist with Specializations in" target="_blank" title="Valencia College's Computer Programming Specialist certificate program (link opens in new window/tab)">Computer Programming Specialist certificate program</a> at <a href="https://valenciacollege.edu" target="_blank" title="Valencia College (link opens in new window/tab)">Valencia College</a>. After years of programming experience, I have decided to pursue a career as a Web developer. Ideally, I want to work for a non-profit or any organization dedicated to doing good in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                I care about humanity and our planet, and support charities that help with hunger, water access, and disaster relief. I try to get to the root causes of issues before they become big problems. I have a good sense of humor; however, I take important matters seriously.
                </p>
